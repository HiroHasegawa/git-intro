## Before We Start
1. Create a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join?source=header-home)
2. Download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) - Windows, Mac, and Linux are supported
3. A simple text editor, such as [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) is helpful, but not crucial
